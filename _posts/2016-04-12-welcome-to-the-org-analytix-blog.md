Welcome to the Org Analytix blog!

Before we get started, here is a quick introduction on Org Analytix:

[Org Analytix][0] is a new Social Capital analysis SaaS platform that will allow managers and team leaders to run their teams more effectively by understanding the team dynamics driving performance and behavior.

This analysis can be applied to a variety of situations and can help managers achieve different goals, such as:

* Enhance **Employee Engagement **and Decrease Employee Turnover
* Boost Employee **Productivity**
* Effective **M&A Integration**
* Mitigate **Operational Risk **by identifying _Key Man Dependencies, Decision Bottlenecks and Knowledge Hoarders_
* Enhance **Innovation & Collaboration **across your organization

Our easy to use tool performs complex network simulations of employee relationships to visually depict employee relationships, as well as determine who fills in the key roles in the network and what if any gaps exists within the organization.

When would leaders use this tool?

Anytime there is a significant volatility in the work environment impacting the team -- some examples include:

* M&A transaction underway impacting the company
* High employee turnover issues
* Regulatory changes impacting work processes
* Technological upgrades impacting how work gets done in the organization

Our tool is still in development stage with our MVP (Minimally Viable Product) up and running.  We are currently in a beta testing phase of the product development and welcome any pilot opportunities to perform this analysis for companies currently in need for new tools to understand how to make the team work most efficiently.
